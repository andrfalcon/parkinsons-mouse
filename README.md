People diagnosed with Parkinson's disease have tremors across their entire body. These tremors can cause unsteadiness
in the hands and can make it especially difficult for those with Parkinson's to use a computer mouse. This software
tracks the tremors of those with Parkinson's and steadies the mouse pointer movement so that they can more easily use
computers.
